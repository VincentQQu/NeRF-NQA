# NeRF-NQA


This is the repository for paper "NeRF-NQA: No-Reference Quality Assessment for Scenes Generated by NeRF and Neural View Synthesis Methods" published on [IEEE TVCG](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10459060).

##### The GitHub repository has been integrated into [our latest work](https://github.com/VincentQQu/NeRF-SNQA), which employs a self-supervised method to learn quality features.
